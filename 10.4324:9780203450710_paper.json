This implies that you can choose the number of sine waves to compose, thus giving increased or decreased resolution for the result.\n\nWhat else can I use for this? Can I create images from Fourier series?\nThen I could easily send a thumbnail by only sending the most significant terms of the series?","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":119},{"content":"Is this going from design of the filter to the details of the filter?\n\nSo what's the angular frequency? and what's that w symbol?\n\nWhy is f both frequency and rotations?","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":117},{"content":"I still can't tell what eigenfunction and transfer function actually mean\n\nWhat are terminal and interval values?","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":116},{"content":"I need to do further reading on the \"noiseless coding theorem of Shannon\" cause I don't quite get this.","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":100},{"content":"Is this related to the bayesian theory of surprise described at http://ilab.usc.edu/surprise/ ?\n\nHow far does the proposed definition, for example Shannon's definition of information, agree with the original concepts you had, and how far does it differ?","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":99},{"content":"Press Enter to edit this note","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":5},{"content":"page 56 notes","paperuid":"10.4324/9780203450710","pageNumber":65},{"content":"This is one of my favorite books ever!
